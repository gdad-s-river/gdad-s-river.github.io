I started my career as a web developer as a trainee in Sapient Nitro a year back, as a Junior Interactive Developer, which is a fancy sugar coating on a Trainee, really. For the first 6 months I was tested through my patient, nights, self doubts, friends earning tripple / quadruple. At one night when only a yellow CFL was on in the room I'd even decided that I wouldn't be able to handle it. [I don't have sort of friends can have my back, hell I don't even know how can I have my back](https://www.facebook.com/notes/swastika-jajoo/notes-on-not-being-special-enough/687472464744590). I'd packed my bags and staring at an airline's cheapest flights to go back home. 

Now I think of it, had I acted upon that fear and initimidation, I'd have been in a worse off situation because of two reasons

1. Things in the family were going to go off the charts crazy, like ripping people's lives and minds off. Perhaps I'd have been able to handle the situation better, but I highly think it wouldn't have made the difference. Because I tried even after being in Bangalore and meeting in person, nothing resolved. 

2. I'd not have been able to see my face very often in the mirror.

So coming back to point, I stuck on the hope and I'm in a better place. I give talks in meetups, discuss with people, learn from them. BUT MOS IMPORTANTLY, as I'd had this revelation only lately, I learn the most by coming back to the things that I didn't understand the first time I read it. Those are the kind of things that just stick on the mind after all along. I have a very bad retention power, I can't cramp, for be able to remember only what it said, even though I didn't understand any of it. 

Learning web development, all the patterns nuances and more, and working on a team that's developing a framework solution for a particular need in the company, I realized that I learnt the most when I got back to things that were left **Un-Understood**. 

I think this is common pattern in the developers starting off. And as people start gaining experience, there are fewer things with time, that developers aren't able to understand in the first go of the read. It's been a good ride til now. I'm not caring for not making too much money because of money. Perhaps that'll pay back sometime in the future. Hopes are always up.
