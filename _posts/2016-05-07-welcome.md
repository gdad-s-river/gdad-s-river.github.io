At first I tried going fancy with [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) static site generator, but then, when atlassian's integration with free aerobatic hosting gave in to the fifth blog post, the build failing saying **Not Enough Space blala**, I thought it was worth going to the modern classics for static site generation and hosting (github pages). The original [blog](https://gdad-s-river.com) is still live, but I don't intend to live there much longer.
