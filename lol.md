## LOL: Weekly (List Of Lit) Links and Things

LOL is a weekly curated newsletter containing literary articles, poems, spoken word performances, essays, and blog posts that I read in a week. This is the era of browser tab disasters. The other day I saw a developer's tweet about how a big number of opened tabs hung his computer, corrupted his file system, only after which he stopped using his browser tabs as a todo list. We gulp web content like crazy. Get swayed away most of the times, lose ourselves in waves of hyperlinks, to find ourselves having wasted time like it was recyclable, because of which, the word "commitment" doubles its meaning. I'm here to help a little. I will ease down some of your browser tab mania through a list of small numbered things that I read in a week, so that you could enjoy them, and get back to work. Who has time in this world!

If you're game, or you play games, or if you don't.

Okay, re-try.

If you want to give a shot to read what I read over, in a week, please subscribe! Don't worry, I'll only nudge your email once a week every IST Sunday, and you'll always have a tiny little gray colored button to unsubscribe if you happen to incline doing so.
