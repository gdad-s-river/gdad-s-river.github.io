# Pretty Jekyll Skeleton Template
An incredibly simple skeleton template for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to get you started. It's not meant to be a perfectly complete blog theme but rather a starting point if you want to experiment with static website generators and [build your own template](https://ines.io/blog/the-ultimate-guide-static-websites-jekyll).

*This template was originally developed for [The ultimate guide to static websites with Jekyll](https://ines.io/blog/the-ultimate-guide-static-websites-jekyll).*
