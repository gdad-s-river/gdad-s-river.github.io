TL;DR : 

I made [this](https://bhavri.github.io). An SVG Stroke Animation, which I had to make because I'm a fan of writing and receiving letters. In the past two years, I've written 10s of letters, received a few 10s as well. I've a big pouch crowdedly packed with all of them. A couple of them are outside the pouch now, because there is no more room. 

I started with the awesome [Jake Archibald](https://twitter.com/jaffathecake)'s [Article](https://jakearchibald.com/2013/animated-line-drawing-svg/). This is, in short a very easy way to animate a stroked svg (bulk in paths, so to speak), by animating `stroke-dashoffset` property. At the end of the article, this was so cool, typical super cool and awesome Jake. I became a die hard fan when he gave his talk at Bangalore's PWA Summit. Okay now, yes, this :

Before this I had the idea of using [GSAP DrawSVGPlugin](https://greensock.com/drawSVG), but ALAS, I didn't want to pay for it, so that was that.

Then I saw [this](https://codepen.io/munkholm/pen/EaZJQE) pen, and I wondered if it was possible to convert font objects in a vector graphics editor to stroke path text svgs. This pen made it seem so (I still don't know how this is done). I have a rough idea that, it might have been done using a technique similar to that shown in this [medium article](https://medium.com/@gordonnl/stylised-line-animations-ded23320ffe5#.jb5a4whlx). Now I'm no expert in graphics or for that matter web design, but I think this is it. And I'll like to learn how masking is so seamlessly done, and how these text shapes are made at the first place (Do we mask the text object in the graphics editor like inkscape and illustrator, can anybody start me where I could learn that?). Anyway, once I'm done with the projects that I've in mind (which is a lot), this will be the next quest.

Okay wait, yes, that's how it is done! Masking the text shapes in the vector graphics editor. See what I found from one of my searching tweets:

Whops! I forget to tell, whom I wanted to make this for. If you've already seen what I made, you already know her name. She's like my spriritual doppelganger. So yeah.

There was also, I remember, a method to make this work on canvas, but I didn't like it so I left it right there.

I started diving into what actually svg paths are and  how they work by reading [Sitepoint's closer look at svg path](https://www.sitepoint.com/closer-look-svg-path-data/). It was informative, but I couldn't get anything that I wanted, out of it.

And oh, even before anything else, I actually thought there would be an available node module. I found one, it was called text-to-svg, and I thought my work was done there! But ALAS! I was to find, that it would convert the text into svgs which are not stroked svgs but outlined, which were essentially filled with color,and the fill property in svg can't be animated.

That's when I stumbed upon an article that explained, [why it is not possible to make such a plugin](http://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/39178/animate-drawing-of-svg-text/40990#40990?newreg=753c630034d34d3bbf5dca7a9da28ebd). And it made complete sense. So the intention that I had, of automating everything I did wasn't possible (at least yet). I knew I was in for a manual ride.

I didn't explore [opentype](http://opentype.js.org/) much. It sort of gave access to the glyps (path points) somehow ? I guess ? I don't really know. 

And oh, by the way, like Jake Archibald, the magician Chris Coyer also had a [smiliar article](https://css-tricks.com/svg-line-animation-works/) on css tricks. 

There were a number of stackoverflow questions [like this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32060838/svg-handwriting-animation-without-using-stroke-properties), which shared the problem I was trying to solve, but I needed something very quick, and something that would just work. I needn't necessary had to make it very pretty like the medium article I shared above. I just wanted a long letter to be written online. 

Fortunately I messaged [Alyssa](https://twitter.com/AlyssaNicoll) on twitter to ask for her suggestions or advice (whatever she'd have). And fortunately she did have some pointers that would eventually help me. SVG Stroke Fonts to the rescue! Sort of. 

I read the [article that talked about Hershey's Text Extension in Inkscape](http://www.evilmadscientist.com/2011/hershey-text-an-inkscape-extension-for-engraving-fonts/)

Then I used [Vivus](https://github.com/maxwellito/vivus) to animate them in a callback hell (which I opened an issue for)

![Issues! Yay!]({{site.url}}/assets/images/bhavri-github-issues.png)

![Unacceptable Manual Callback Chaining]({{site.url}}/assets/images/bhavri-github-callbacks.png)

Also there's a forced jag towards the poem, at the end,which is nothing but forced scrolldown push of the page, so that the requestAnimationFrame remains active,and the animation doesn't stop there, because of being out of the viewport; which I've to better, by sensing when there is a vertical scroll (when it actuall comes,that is), and the smoothly animating the scroll to the next line of svg animation continuation(in the issues as well). 

This is the end of the rant. Thank you everybody, whom I could have missed, whose blogposts, I'd have read and learnt from. Really, thank you!
