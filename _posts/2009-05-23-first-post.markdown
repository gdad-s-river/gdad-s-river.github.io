Whew! After many years of on and off editing, I finally built a site that I love to call home.  Big thanks to the folks at Github for adding this feature to their service.  Seems that every time I look at the site, there is a new feature.

Now my plans are to post at least once per month with topics about programming and other geeky stuff.  I'll be making my first real post in the next couple of weeks.
