Whatever is written below is not about design. I figured it wasn't about design after I went out on a saturday evening to eat something out, with my flatmate, who's a soon to be closure backend developer now. So until I update this post, please don't read it.

I watched Aaron Swartz's documentary and somewhere in between I watched his T shirt which said **_Design is the Solution to Every Problem_**, or *Design can solve everything* or likewise. All the data structures and maps worth of thoughts came to my mind which I'm unable to remember now. Here I try to remember and write what I, remember.

**Mind**: A properly designed mind, can solve everything. What's the metric of properly designed mind? You *keep* yourself happy no matter what. That is possible when you are the controller of your emotions, rather than the vice versa. No matter how strong a problem is, is always taken care of if taken as a challenge. Aaron taught me that. Like in this [epic stand up comedy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQHsVPD5Ans) Jim Carrey rightly said in between, that there are moments when a thought comes ( we don't know from where ), we choose or not to choose to act upon it. A superbly designed mind,

* **Meditates** when it can, just like brushing and shitting is an everyday ( every night, every evening, every noon, whatever you prefer ) activity. This helps in keeping the stream (oh God! That node module that involved knowing node streams is still pending! ) of thoughts wonderful at first place (devoid of most of the noise), and then enable us to choose upon the thoughts wisely. For example, my long time college classmate, and later (now) flatmate, [narendraj9](http://vicarie.in/) has a way of asking or telling things (sometimes) that is usually used by people while either being rude, sarcastic, blunt or all the P & C's of three. But he is (most of the times) not. I got to know this by being patient and accepting, and not letting momentary emotions provocate my mind (designed mind).

* **Forgives**: As Aaron said in his blogposts and videos, time is too less to hold grudges against people. It's the highlight of a highly designed mind, holding grudges is not efficient and performant because
* It wastes time
* There're high chances you might end up regreting holding grudges in the latter parts of your life (then what's the point of having them anyway)?
* It isn't very health efficient

So forgive: infidelity, children forgetting what they were told to do, a broken promise, deaths, etc. Just forgive and sleep, already!

* **Haves Compassion**: A highly designed mind is the most logical one. Rather than irking and having pity on something/someone, it is compassionate for others, knowing that
* Finding intentions behind others' mistakes is foolish, because mistakes happen when a person is in ignorance (for example brain washed terrorists, now I'm not saying to forgive terrorism, no! I'm saying to forgive those ill treated brain washed minds, who are dead anyway, and take actions to eradicate terrorism by whatever means necessary), && when s/he doesn't know that s/he's making mistakes (unless s/he's feigning them, knowing there's no strict *punishment* for them. Don't worry, this is easily caught).
* Having compassion, is saying *it's alright, let's start again, let me help you*, but not really saying it outloud. Showing it in expressions and actions, without making other people know anything about anything. A highly designed mind, looks for the short path for the most efficient problem solution. Having compassion is one of them.

Design is not a curriculum, it's a way of life. It solves problem we don't even consciously think about, like what order of errand items would cater to the least distance traveled, how fast do I have to get ready in order to not be late (not lame, smart), do I wash my under wear today or tomorrow in order to not be late, how do I [write smartly](http://stevenpinker.com/publications/sense-style-thinking-persons-guide-writing-21st-century), how to code that shit in the most memory and code performant way, how to build that building... Anything that can fall after _How To (fill in the blank)_ could be a design problem. How to kiss best, how to not get caught while entering a class late, you get the point.

Anytime there is a problem statement, it's a design problem. It's a design problem to judge the correct size when you are shopping online, it's a design problem to keep track of different conversations while chatting, to get up early, to solve the Bangalore traffic problem (Fazal, you can do it!), and the list is never ending.
