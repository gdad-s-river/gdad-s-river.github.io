- [Alumni Network Growth Hack](http://gdad-s-river.github.io/alma-connect-growth-hack/): Weekend Hack, to get attention of alumni to rebuild (read *build*) the Alumni Network]
- [Summer School Growth Hack](http://gdad-s-river.github.io/summer-school-nith/): Weekend Hack, to promote research learning, in an effort for students of alma mater to attend a workshop from Dr. Auroop R Gangula, Professor at Northeastern Uni, Boston, Mass
- [Stroke SVG Animations, an online letter to a wonderful person](https://gdad-s-river.github.io/bhavri.github.io/)
- [LOL Link Sharer Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lol-link-sharer/jjllphofpikbebeielgakcpinafagmnn) which helps me leverage the fact that people read good literature/art/visual, generative art links, which helps me curate links for my weekly newsletter [LOL](https://gdad-s-river.github.io/lol)
- [Harshini Raji's Porfolio](https://github.com/gdad-s-river/harshini-portfolio) Website using Greensock, Gatsby, Reactjs
- [People of NITH](https://github.com/gdad-s-river/Vulcan-People-of-NITH/tree/peepsofnith): My alma mater doesn't have an alumni network, so nobody could possibly look up anybody who graduated 5 years or 6 years earlier. This was my first attempt at making a celebrated alumni index app using VulcanJS. I've switched to a custom solution with React, Redux and Firebase instead, and currently working on it, starting from scratch.
- [Mother Teresa Trust Fund](https://motherteresa-welfaretrust.github.io): Used GatsbyJS 1.x to set this up quickly.
