TL;DR : 

I made [this](https://bhavri.github.io). An SVG Stroke Animation, which I had to make because I'm a fan of writing and receiving letters. In the past two years, I've written 10s of letters, received a few 10s as well. I've a big pouch crowdedly packed with all of them. A couple of them are outside the pouch now, because there is no more room. 

I started with the awesome [Jake Archibald](https://twitter.com/jaffathecake)'s [Article](https://jakearchibald.com/2013/animated-line-drawing-svg/). This is, in short a very easy way to animate a stroked svg (bulk in paths, so to speak), by animating `stroke-dashoffset` property. At the end of the article, this was so cool, typical super cool and awesome Jake. I became a die hard fan when he gave his talk at Bangalore's PWA Summit. Okay now, yes, this :
