1. **Garden State** : Story of a regular guy who comes to visit home on his mom's funeral
2. **The Descent** : Thriller in the caves
3. **The Descent 2** : Thriller in the caves continued
4. **Tropic Thunder**: Comedy about a film set being real Vietnam Forest
5. **Hard Candy**: Story of a Pedophile
6. **Executive Decision** : The best Airplane Hijacking Recovery I've ever seen.
7. **Jack Reacher** : The thing that I liked about this movie, was that although the plot was not that exciting, the waiting of rolling of the camera to catch the person the other person was talking to, and the way the script was written just like, I'm sure, the book would have been written, all the facts laid up over a particular, but exact, number of pages, nothing revealed until absolutely necessary. It takes a good writer to convert a good plot into an awesome timeline, that's what is done in the movie. I'll admit the movie is a little stretched, with no dramatic music during the thought provoking scenes or the action scenes, but that's exactly put right!
8. **The Brothers Grimsby**: This was like the dictator, only a little less funny. But funny! If I say anything else I'd have to put spoiler alerts, but I can't do that either, since you'll be tempted to read the text that follows anyway. This one is a good one for laughs.
9. **The Truman Show**: Nothing like this I'd seen before. Jim Carrey in a non comedy role is always intriguing and fun to watch. Wonderful concept, wonderful movie.
10. **Sold**: Story of a girl tricked into prostitution, brought from Nepal to Kolkata lured for a job, and how she managed to escape but find happiness in small things in between.
11. **Hidden Figures**: Story of three black women, how their extraordinary skills in calculations, mathematics, engineering and programming, led to some of the first manned missions, and successful ones, in a society which still held black people as almost untouchables, discerned their coffee mugs and machines, lavatories, and what not as separated.
12. **The Book of Love**: Story of loss, empathy, revival, life and happiness, a man and an orphan set out to build a raft, after the man's wife dies in an accident.
